                        <p>Less a dish and more an experience, hot pot is a cooking method where raw ingredients are cooked tableside in a giant pot of simmering broth. There’s a lot of room for variation: different broths, meats, veggies, seafood, noodles and toppings. It’s also meant to be a communal event where everyone sits down together and cooks their food in the same vessel.</p>

                        <p>There are two types of baozi, or bao: dàbāo (big bun) and xiǎobāo (small bun). Both are a bread-like dumpling filled with everything from meat to veggies to bean paste, depending on the type and where they were made. They’re usually steamed—which makes the buns delightfully squishy and soft—and served with dipping sauces like soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil and chile pastes.</p>

                        <p>With a history of more than 1,800 years, dumpling (饺子 Jiǎozi /jyaoww-dzrr/) is a classic lucky food for Lunar New Year, and a traditional dish eaten on Chinese New Year's Eve, widely popular in China, especially in North China.<br>
                            Chinese dumplings can be made to look like Chinese silver ingots (which are not bars, but boat-shaped, oval, and turned up at the two ends). Legend has it that the more dumplings you eat during the New Year celebrations, the more money you can make in the New Year.<br>

Dumplings generally consist of minced meat and finely-chopped vegetables wrapped in a thin and elastic dough skin. Popular fillings are minced pork, diced shrimp, fish, ground chicken, beef, and vegetables. They can be cooked by boiling, steaming, frying or baking.</p>

                        <p>Chinese pork meatballs are also called lion’s head (狮子头, shi zi tou). They feature tender, moist, and light meatballs with a savory taste. This dish is a staple food for my family, because it’s quite easy to cook in big batches and is so comforting to enjoy any time. Eating the savory meatballs with rice is as addictive as eating a burger. Juicy and flavorful meat and starch are the best combo in the world.</p>

                        <p>Chinese raspberry snowflake cake (雪花糕) is a very easy to make and extremely delicious dessert that is usually served cold. It’s one of the perfect desserts to make on a hot summers day and the name “snowflake” has an almost psychological effect that makes you feel like eating this dish will cool you down.<br>

This Chinese dessert is made of raspberries, milk, cream, potato starch, gelatin and desiccated coconut. I used raspberries for this dessert as I like the color of raspberries, but you can also use other fruit such as mango, strawberries, blueberries, or something else.<br>

This recipe for raspberry snowflake cake should taste sweet, but also a bit sour from the acidity of the raspberries.</p>

                        <p>There is a very famous bakery in China serving the pudding coated with desiccated coconut. I loved it after the first bite and thus I have made this lots of time in this summer. To simplify the process, you can simple fridge the mixture in bottles or cups, and then eat directly.

This amount can serve 2-4 people as a sweet dessert. Please do not eat it too much each time because of the high calories. But 4-5 cubes can make your feel much happier. Sometimes I also add some fresh mango in the mixture to create a slightly sweet and sour taste.</p>

                        <p>It’s Chinese New Year soon! Nothing is better than homemade deep fried goodies and one of my favourites is the deep fried sesame cookie balls. Its name is “kai kou xiao” in Mandarin pinyin, meaning “laughing mouth”. Being brought up in a Cantonese family I’ve learnt that they are called “siu hau jo” in Cantonese which translates to “laughing dates”. The cracking part of these cookies makes them look like little laughing heads and having them during the Chinese New Year would bring lots of laughter to you and your family. Not only are they easy to make, they are also very crunchy and tasty. The size makes them so easy to pop into your mouth – overeating alert!</p>
